## Example Usage in Claude

1. **Add an account:**
   "Add my Gmail account with username john@gmail.com"

2. **Check new emails:**
   "Show me the latest 5 emails from my Gmail account"

3. **Search emails:**
   "Search for emails from boss@company.com in the last week"

4. **Send an email:**
   "Send an email to client@example.com with subject 'Project Update'"

5. **Reply to emails:**
   "Reply to the latest email from my boss"

6. **Forward emails:**
   "Forward the email with subject 'Meeting Notes' to team@company.com"

7. **Move emails:**
   "Move the email with UID 12345 from INBOX to the Archive folder"

8. **Manage folders:**
   "List all folders in my email account and show unread counts"

## Batch Operations

The following operations support processing multiple emails at once by using the `uids` parameter (takes precedence if both `uid` and `uids` are provided):

- **Mark multiple emails as read**: Pass an array of UIDs via `uids`
  ```json
  {
    "accountId": "user@example.com",
    "folder": "INBOX",
    "uids": [123, 124, 125]
  }
  ```

- **Mark multiple emails as unread**: Pass an array of UIDs via `uids`
  ```json
  {
    "accountId": "user@example.com",
    "folder": "INBOX",
    "uids": [456, 457, 458]
  }
  ```

- **Delete multiple emails**: Pass an array of UIDs via `uids`
  ```json
  {
    "accountId": "user@example.com",
    "folder": "INBOX",
    "uids": [789, 790, 791]
  }
  ```

- **Move multiple emails**: Pass an array of UIDs via `uids`
  ```json
  {
    "accountId": "user@example.com",
    "sourceFolder": "INBOX",
    "destinationFolder": "Archive",
    "uids": [100, 101, 102]
  }
  ```

**Single email operation** (backward compatible):
```json
{
  "accountId": "user@example.com",
  "folder": "INBOX",
  "uid": 123
}
```

**Note**: Batch operations are atomic - if any email fails, the entire operation fails. All UIDs in a batch must be valid.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

- Ensure your IMAP server settings are correct
- Check if your email provider requires app-specific passwords
- Verify that IMAP is enabled in your email account settings
- For sending emails, ensure your account has SMTP access enabled

### SMTP Configuration

The server automatically configures SMTP settings based on your IMAP provider. If you need custom SMTP settings, you can specify them when adding an account:

```json
{
  "smtp": {
    "host": "smtp.example.com",
    "port": 587,
    "secure": false
  }
}
```

### Common IMAP Settings

- **Gmail**: 
  - Host: imap.gmail.com
  - Port: 993
  - Requires app-specific password

- **Outlook/Hotmail**:
  - Host: outlook.office365.com
  - Port: 993

- **Yahoo**:
  - Host: imap.mail.yahoo.com
  - Port: 993
  - Requires app-specific password
